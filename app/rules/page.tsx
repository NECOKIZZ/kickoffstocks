            <H>A round</H>
            <p>Each round has an entry window, then a running period. When entries close, the start prices are taken. When the round ends, the end prices are taken and the ETFs are ranked by return.</p>
            <p>Prices are Binance&rsquo;s reference price for each tokenized stock, averaged over several samples at the start and at the end, so one odd tick can&rsquo;t decide a round.</p>

            <H>Creators</H>
            <ul>
              <li>Pick 3 to 10 stocks, no stock above 50%, worth at least $10 in total.</li>
              <li>Lock the basket in the league contract with a $5 USDT ticket, and give the ETF a name.</li>
              <li>The basket comes back to you when the round ends, win or lose. Only the ticket is at stake.</li>
              <li>Same stocks at the same weights (to 1%) as an existing ETF? You join that team. The first creator is its captain.</li>
              <li>Leveraged funds (2×, 3×, inverse) are not allowed.</li>
              <li>Everyone can be a creator.</li>
            </ul>

            <H>Backers</H>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Back the team:</b> a $5 ticket on someone&rsquo;s ETF. It wins or loses with that ETF. The creator keeps 10% of what their backers win.</li>
              <li><b>Buy the ETF:</b> buy the same basket through Binance&rsquo;s swap, straight into your wallet. The creator earns the buy fee they set (0&ndash;2%). Nothing is locked; it&rsquo;s your portfolio.</li>
              <li>Do either, or both. One entry per wallet per round.</li>
            </ul>

            <H>Who wins</H>
            <p>ETFs are ranked by return. <b>The top half wins</b> (rounded down; an ETF tied exactly on the line loses). If at least half the ETFs tie for the best return, they all win. A round needs at least 4 ETFs; otherwise everyone is refunded.</p>

            <H>How the pot is split</H>
            <p>The losing tickets form the pot. 10% is taken: 5% for the platform, 5% for the season pot (which tops up thin rounds). The rest goes to the winning teams, by team size × accuracy. Accuracy is how close an ETF came to the best return: the best ETF scores 1, and it drops steeply with distance. Inside a team, every ticket gets the same share, and the creator takes 10% of their backers&rsquo; winnings. A team can win at most 100× what it staked.</p>
            <p>Example: 4 ETFs, each with its creator and 3 backers ($20 per team, $80 in tickets).</p>

            <H id="verify">Settlement you can check</H>
            <p>A keeper takes the prices and runs the open-source settlement. It publishes every input (prices, entries, payouts) and writes their hash on-chain with the payouts. The contract checks that the money adds up and that no payout is out of bounds. Anyone can re-run the maths with <code className="t-num text-[14px]">scripts/verify.mts</code> or on each round&rsquo;s results page.</p>
            <p>If a round isn&rsquo;t settled within 3 days of its end, anyone can void it and everyone is refunded. If a stock token is paused when you claim, your other tokens and your payout still arrive, and you can retry the paused one later.</p>

            <H id="risk">Risks</H>
            <ul>
              <li>&ldquo;ETF&rdquo; here means an on-chain basket of tokenized stocks, not a regulated fund.</li>
              <li>Stock prices move: your basket can lose value while it&rsquo;s locked, and a losing ticket is lost.</li>
              <li>Tokenized stocks are issued by third parties (bStocks, Ondo) and follow their rules, including where they&rsquo;re available. Not available in restricted regions.</li>
              <li>Smart contracts can have bugs. Play with money you can afford to lose.</li>
